## Overview 

This is a basic page showing the QR code that directs to Frontend Mentor website.
I used only HTML and CSS to complete this challange.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Media Queries
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In order to make the page responsive I learnt about CSS Media Queries and Flexbox.
I used Media Queries to specify different widths and font sizes for different screen sizes.
And I used Flexbox to center the elements both horizentally and vertically.

### Continued development

I aim to focus on having a better understanding and deployment of CSS Media Queries and learing about CSS grid.
